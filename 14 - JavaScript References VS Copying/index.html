    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // Value for age will change but age2 will stay the same
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    age = 200;
    // console.log(age, age2);
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // refference will change original array
    const team = players;
    team[3] = "Gio";
    // console.log(players, team);

    // Use slice to copy array without effecting original Arrays
    const team2 = players.slice();
    console.log(team2);
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // Object.assign First make an empty object
    // Then grab an object to copy it into
    // Thirst change an object value
    // Original object will not be effected
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 99});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};

    // console.log(cap3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
